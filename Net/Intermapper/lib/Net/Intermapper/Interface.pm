=head1 NAME

Net::Cisco::ACS::User - Access Cisco ACS functionality through REST API - User fields

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Net::Cisco::ACS;
	use Net::Cisco::ACS::User;
  
	my $acs = Net::Cisco::ACS->new(hostname => '10.0.0.1', username => 'acsadmin', password => 'testPassword');
	my $user = Net::Cisco::ACS::User->new("name"=>"soloh","description"=>"Han Solo","identityGroupName"=>"All Groups:MilleniumCrew","password"=>"Leia");

	my %users = $acs->users;
	# Retrieve all users from ACS
	# Returns hash with username / Net::Cisco::ACS::User pairs
	
	print $acs->users->{"acsadmin"}->toXML;
	# Dump in XML format (used by ACS for API calls)
	
	my $user = $acs->users("name","acsadmin");
	# Faster call to request specific user information by name

	my $user = $acs->users("id","150");
	# Faster call to request specific user information by ID (assigned by ACS, present in Net::Cisco::ACS::User)

	$user->id(0); # Required for new user!
	my $id = $acs->create($user);
	# Create new user based on Net::Cisco::ACS::User instance
	# Return value is ID generated by ACS
	print "Record ID is $id" if $id;
	print $Net::Cisco::ACS::ERROR unless $id;
	# $Net::Cisco::ACS::ERROR contains details about failure

	my $id = $acs->update($user);
	# Update existing user based on Net::Cisco::ACS::User instance
	# Return value is ID generated by ACS
	print "Record ID is $id" if $id;
	print $Net::Cisco::ACS::ERROR unless $id;
	# $Net::Cisco::ACS::ERROR contains details about failure

	$acs->delete($user);
	# Delete existing user based on Net::Cisco::ACS::User instance
	
=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Net::Cisco::ACS::User class holds all the user relevant information from Cisco ACS 5.x
