=head1 NAME

Net::Intermapper::Vertice - Interface with the HelpSystems Intermapper HTTP API - Vertices 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Intermapper;
  my $intermapper = Net::Intermapper->new(hostname=>"10.0.0.1", username=>"admin", password=>"nmsadmin");
  # Options:
  # hostname - IP or hostname of Intermapper 5.x and 6.x server
  # username - Username of Administrator user
  # password - Password of user
  # ssl - SSL enabled (1 - default) or disabled (0)
  # port - TCP port for querying information. Defaults to 8181
  # modifyport - TCP port for modifying information. Default to 443
  # cache - Boolean to enable smart caching or force network queries

  my %users = $intermapper->users;
  my $users_ref = $intermapper->users;
  # Retrieve all users from Intermapper, Net::Intermapper::User instances
  # Returns hash or hashref, depending on context
  
  my %devices = $intermapper->devices;
  my $devices_ref = $intermapper->devices;
  # Retrieve all devices from Intermapper, Net::Intermapper::Device instances
  # Returns hash or hashref, depending on context

  my %maps = $intermapper->maps;
  my $maps_ref = $intermapper->maps;
  # Retrieve all maps from Intermapper, Net::Intermapper::Map instances
  # Returns hash or hashref, depending on context

  my %interfaces = $intermapper->interfaces;
  my $interfaces_ref = $intermapper->interfaces;
  # Retrieve all interfaces from Intermapper, Net::Intermapper::Interface instances
  # Returns hash or hashref, depending on context

  my %vertices = $intermapper->vertices;
  my $vertices_ref = $intermapper->vertices;
  # Retrieve all vertices from Intermapper, Net::Intermapper::Vertice instances
  # Returns hash or hashref, depending on context

  my $user = $intermapper->users->{"admin"};
  
  # Each class will generate specific header. These are typically only for internal use but are compliant to the import format Intermapper uses.
  print $user->header; 
  print $device->header;
  print $map->header;
  print $interface->header;
  print $vertice->header;

  print $user->toTAB;
  print $device->toXML; # This one is broken still!
  print $map->toCSV;
  # Works on ALL subclasses
  # Produce human-readable output of each record in the formats Intermapper supports
  
  my $user = Net::Intermapper::User->new(Name=>"testuser", Password=>"Test12345");
  my $response = $intermapper->create($user);
  # Create new user
  # Return value is HTTP::Response object
  
  my $device = Net::Intermapper::Device->new(Name=>"testDevice", MapName=>"TestMap", MapPath=>"/TestMap", Address=>"10.0.0.1");
  my $response = $intermapper->create($device);
  # Create new device
  # Return value is HTTP::Response object

  $user->Password("Foobar123");
  my $response = $intermapper->update($user);
  # Update existing user
  # Return value is HTTP::Response object

  my $user = $intermapper->users->{"bob"};
  my $response = $intermapper->delete($user);
  # Delete existing user
  # Return value is HTTP::Response object

  my $device = $intermapper->devices->{"UniqueDeviceID"};
  my $response = $intermapper->delete($device);
  # Delete existing device
  # Return value is HTTP::Response object

  my $users = { "Tom" => $tom_user, "Bob" => $bob_user };
  $intermapper->users($users);
  # At this point, there is no real reason to do this as update, create and delete work with explicit arguments.
  # But it can be done with users, devices, interfaces, maps and vertices
  # Pass a hashref to each method. This will NOT affect the smart-caching (only explicit calls to create, update and delete do this - for now).
	
=head1 USAGE
  
=over 3

=item new

Class constructor. Returns object of Net::Intermapper::Vertice on succes. Attributes are:

=over 5

=item MapName (read-only)

Name of the map file containing the vertex.

=item Id (read-only)

A unique, persistent identifier for this vertex instance. The id will be unique across all maps on a single InterMapper server. This value is used for lookups in the C<users> method in L<Net::Intermapper>.

=item Name (read-only)

The name of the vertex. The name is the first non-empty line in a device or network's label on a map.

=item Color (read-write)

Color (valid names: white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, green, brown)

=item FontName (read-write)

Font name, eg. Bodoni MT

=item FontSize (read-write)

Font size in points.

=item FontStyle (read-write)

Font style (bold, italic, plain)

=item Label (read-only)

Vertex label.

=item LabelPosition (read-write)

Label position. Valid values are topleft, top, topright, left, center, right, bottomleft, bottom, bottomright

=item LabelTemplate (read-write)

Vertex label template.

=item LabelVisible (read-write)

True if the vertex label is visible (only used when the device is represented by an icon)

=item MapId (read-only)

The unique Id of the map file containing the vertex.

=item Origin (read-write)

The origin determines whether the vertex coordinates are relative to the center or one of the sides of the vertex. Valid values: center, top, left, right, botom, topleft, topright, bottomright, bottomleft.

=item Shape (read-write)

Vertex shape (rect, oval, wire, cloud, text, or icon name).

=item VantagePoint (read-write)

True if the vertex is a vantage point of the graph

=item XCoordinate (read-write)

Horizontal map coordinate, the positive direction is to the right.

=item YCoordinate (read-write)

Vertical map coordinate, the positive direction is to the bottom.

=item VertexId (read-only)

The Vertex Id of the vertex. Corresponds to the device with a matching VertexID in the devices table.

=back

=over 3

=item header

Returns the C<directive> aka data header required by the Intermapper API to perform CRUD actions. This is handled through the C<create>, C<update> and C<delete> method and should not really be used.

=back

=over 3 

=item toTAB

Returns the object data formatted in TAB delimited format. Used in combination with the C<header> and the C<format> method in L<Net::Intermapper> to perform CRUD actions. This is handled through the C<create>, C<update> and C<delete> method and should not really be used.

=back

=over 3

=item toCSV

Returns the object data formatted in Comma Separated delimited format. Used in combination with the C<header> and the C<format> method in L<Net::Intermapper> to perform CRUD actions. This is handled through the C<create>, C<update> and C<delete> method and should not really be used.

=back

=over 3

=item toXML

Returns the object data formatted in XML format. Used in combination with the C<header> and the C<format> method in L<Net::Intermapper> to perform CRUD actions. This is handled through the C<create>, C<update> and C<delete> method and should not really be used.

=back

=over 3

=item mode

Internal method to properly format the data and header for CRUD actions. Typically not used.

=back

=item $ERROR

NEEDS TO BE ADDED

This variable will contain detailed error information.	
	
=back

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

For this library to work, you need an instance with Intermapper (obviously) or a simulator like L<Net::Intermapper::Mock>.
