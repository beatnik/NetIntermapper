  use Net::Intermapper;
  my $intermapper = Net::Intermapper->new(hostname=>"10.0.0.1", username=>"admin", password=>"nmsadmin");
  # Options:
  # hostname - IP or hostname of Intermapper 5.x server
  # username - Username of Administrator user
  # password - Password of user
  # ssl - SSL enabled (1 - default) or disabled (0)
  # port - TCP port for querying information. Defaults to 8181
  # modifyport - TCP port for modifying information. Default to 443

  print Dumper $intermapper->users;
  # Retrieve all users from Intermapper
  # Returns hash with user name / Net::Intermapper::User pairs
  
  print Dumper $intermapper->devices;
  # Retrieve all devices from Intermapper
  # Returns hash with device name / Net::Intermapper::Device pairs
  
  print Dumper $intermapper->maps;
  # Retrieve all maps from Intermapper
  # Returns hash with map name / Net::Intermapper::Map pairs
  
  print Dumper $intermapper->interfaces;
  # Retrieve all interfaces from Intermapper
  # Returns hash with interface ID / Net::Intermapper::Interface pairs
  
  print Dumper $intermapper->vertices;  
  # Retrieve all vertices from Intermapper
  # Returns hash with name / Net::Intermapper::Vertice pairs

  my $user = $intermapper->users->{"admin"};
  print $user->header; 
  # Generate 'directive' needed for manipulation. Mostly used internally.
  # $user->mode("create"); # This changes the header fields
  # $user->mode("update"); # This also changes the header fields
  # Both are NOT needed when adding or updating a record
  print $user->toTAB;
  print $user->toXML;
  print $user->toCSV;
  # Produce human-readable output of each record. 
  
  my $user = Net::Intermapper::User->new(Name=>"testuser", Password=>"Test12345");

  # Create new user
  
  my $device = Net::Intermapper::Device->new(Name=>"testDevice", MapName=>"TestMap", MapPath=>"/TestMap", Address=>"10.0.0.1");
  print Dumper $intermapper->create($device);
  # Create new device

  $user->Password("Foobar123");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Intermapper::Device is a perl wrapper around the HelpSystems Intermapper API provided through HTTP/HTTPS for access to device information.

All calls are handled through an instance of the L<Net::Intermapper> class.

  use Net::Intermapper;
  my $intermapper = Net::Intermapper->new(hostname => '10.0.0.1', username => 'admin', password => 'nmsadmin');

=head1 USAGE

=over 3

=item new

Class constructor. Returns object of Net::Intermapper::Device on succes. Attributes are:

=over 5

=item MapName (read-only)

Name of the map containing the device.

=item MapPath (read-only)

Full path of the map containing the device, including the name of the map.

=item Address (read-write)

The IP or AppleTalk address of the device that is probed by InterMapper. The IP address is represented in dotted-decimal notation, e.g. 'a.b.c.d'. The AppleTalk address is represented in slash notation, e.g. 'a/b'.

=item Id (read-only)

A unique, persistent identifier for this device instance. The Id will be unique across all maps on a single InterMapper server. This value is used for lookups in the C<users> method in L<Net::Intermapper>.

=item Name (read-only)

The name of the device. The name is the first non-empty line in a device's label on a map.

=item Probe (read-write)

The human-readable name of the InterMapper probe.

=item Comment (read-write)

The comment associated with the device.

=item Community (read-write)

The SNMP community of the device.

=item DisplayIfUnNumbered (read-write)

True if the device's behaviour is set to display unnumbered interfaces.

=item DNSName (read-write)

The fully-qualified DNS name of the device.

=item IgnoreIfAppleTalk (read-write)

True if the device's behaviour is to ignore AppleTalk interface information.

=item IgnoreIfDiscards (read-write)

True if the device's behaviour is to ignore interface discards.

=item IgnoreIfErrors (read-write)

True if the device's behaviour is to ignore interface errors.

=item IgnoreOutages (read-write)

True if the device's behaviour is to ignore outages.

=item AllowPeriodicReprobe (read-write)

True if the device's behaviour is to allow periodic reprobe.

=item IMProbe (read-write)

A special URL representation describing the InterMapper probe and its parameters, e.g. improbe://address:port/...

=item Latitude (read-write)

The latitude of the device. The value will be a double within the range [-90..90] or empty string if the device does not have this attribute set.

=item Longitude (read-write)

The longitude of the device. The value will be a double within the range [-180..180] or empty string if the device does not have this attribute set.

=item LastTimeDown (read-only)

The time when the device last went down. Value is 0 if device has not gone down since we started monitoring it.

=item LastTimeSysUp (read-only)

The time when the device last came up (ie rebooted), based on the value of sysUpTime. The value is 0 if unknown.

=item LastTimeUp (read-only)

The time when the device status last transitioned from DOWN to UP. Value is 0 if this has not happened since we started monitoring.

=item MACAddress (read-only)

The device's MAC Address. If the device has multiple interfaces, this field will contain the MAC Address associated with the device's main IP Address (the same address in the address field).
